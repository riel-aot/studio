# Changelog

This document will track all significant changes made to the ClassPulse application during our development sessions.

## Initial Documentation Setup

- **Project Initialization**: Started with the base Next.js project structure for ClassPulse.
- **Documentation Created**:
    - Created this `CHANGELOG.md` to record a high-level history of updates.
    - Created `VARIABLES.md` to define common naming conventions.
    - Noted the existence of other detailed documentation files in this directory:
        - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Explains the overall system design.
        - `WEBHOOK_CONTRACT.md`: Defines the API for frontend-backend communication, including all webhook events.
        - `N8N_WORKFLOWS.md`: Describes the backend business logic for each webhook.
        - `SECURITY_NOTES.md`: Covers important security considerations.

We will keep these documents updated as we build out the application.
